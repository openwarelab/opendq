# This is a pretty trivial ebuild, as the python distutils support takes care of
# just about everything for us.  Our only real problem is that the project name
# as far as distutils is concerned is PyDispatcher rather than pydispatcher.
# We get around that by defining DISTUTILS_NAME as the capitalised name,
# and then provide a similar customisation point DISTUTILS_VERSION which
# lets us define e.g. 1.0.0a1 (which is how the package is normally numbered)
# when an alpha/beta/etc version comes out with only minimal changes to this
# file.
